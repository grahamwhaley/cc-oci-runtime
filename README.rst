``cc-oci-runtime``
===================

Overview
--------

``cc-oci-runtime`` is an Open Containers Initiative (OCI_) "runtime"
that launches an Intel_ VT-x secured Clear Containers 2.0 hypervisor,
rather than a standard Linux container. It leverages the highly
optimised `Clear Linux`_ technology to achieve this goal.

The tool is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2 and aims to be
compatible with the OCI_ runtime specification [#oci-spec]_, allowing
Clear Containers to be launched transparently by Docker_ (using
containerd_) and other OCI_-conforming container managers.

Henceforth, the tool will simply be referred to as "the runtime".

See the canonical `cc-oci-runtime home page`_ for the latest
information.

Quick Start
-----------

If you are eager to install and start using Clear Containers, please
refer to the installation instructions on the wiki:

- https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/wiki/installation

Requirements
------------

- A Qemu_ hypervisor that supports the ``pc-lite`` machine type (see qemu-2.7-lite_ branch).
- CONFIG_VHOST_NET enabled in the host kernel

Platform Support
----------------

the runtime supports running Clear Containers on Intel 64-bit (x86-64)
Linux systems.

Supported Application Versions
------------------------------

The runtime has been tested with the following application versions:

- Docker_ version 1.12.1.
- Containerd_ version 0.2.2.

Design
------

See `the design document <https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/blob/master/DESIGN.rst>`_.

Limitations
-----------

See:

- https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/wiki/Limitations

Running under ``docker``
------------------------

Assuming a Docker_ 1.12 environment, start the Docker_ daemon specifying
the "``--add-runtime $alias=$path``" option. For example::

    $ sudo dockerd --add-runtime cor=/usr/bin/cc-oci-runtime

Then, to run a Clear Container using the runtime, specify "``--runtime cor``".

For example::

    $ sudo docker run --runtime cor -ti busybox

Note that if you wish to pass options to the runtime such as
``--global-log`` (see Logging_) and ``--debug`` (see Debugging_), you
should instead configure Docker to invoke the helper script like this::

    $ sudo dockerd --add-runtime cor=/usr/bin/cc-oci-runtime.sh

The helper script will call the real runtime binary with the options you
specify. Runtime options can either be passed to the runtime binary by
creating a ``cc-oci-runtime.sh.cfg`` configuration file, or by modifying
``/usr/bin/cc-oci-runtime.sh`` directly. See the contents of this script
for instructions.

Running under ``containerd`` (without Docker)
---------------------------------------------

If you are running Containerd_ directly, without Docker_:

- Start the server daemon::

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/containerd --debug --runtime $PWD/cc-oci-runtime

- Launch a hypervisor::

    $ name=foo

    # XXX: path to directory containing atleast the following:
    #
    #   config.json
    #   rootfs/
    #
    $ bundle_dir=...

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/ctr --debug containers start --attach "$name" "$bundle_dir"

- Forcibly stop the hypervisor::

    $ name=foo
    $ sudo ./cc-oci-runtime stop "$name"

Running stand-alone
-------------------

The runtime can be run directly, without the need for either ``docker``
or ``containerd``::

    $ name=foo
    $ pidfile=/tmp/cor.pid
    $ logfile=/tmp/cor.log
    $ sudo ./cc-oci-runtime --debug create --console $(tty) --bundle "$bundle_dir" "$name"
    $ sudo ./cc-oci-runtime --debug start "$name"

Or, to simulate how ``containerd`` calls the runtime::

    $ sudo ./cc-oci-runtime --log "$logfile" --log-format json create --bundle "$bundle_dir" --console $(tty) --pid-file "$pidfile" "$name"
    $ sudo ./cc-oci-runtime --log "$logfile" --log-format json start "$name"

Running as a non-privileged user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the following provisos, the runtime can be run as a non-``root`` user:

- User has read+write permissions for the Clear Containers root
  filesystem image specified in the ``vm`` JSON object (see
  Configuration_).

- User has read+execute permissions for the Clear Containers kernel
  image specified in the ``vm`` JSON object (see Configuration_).

- The bundle configuration file ("``config.json``") does not specify any
  mounts that the runtime must honour.

- The runtime is invoked with the "``--root=$dir``" option where
  "``$dir``" is a pre-existing directory that the user has write
  permission to.

To run non-privileged::

    $ name=foo
    $ dir=/tmp/cor
    $ mkdir -p "$dir"
    $ ./cc-oci-runtime --root "$dir" create --console $(tty) --bundle "$oci_bundle_directory" "$name"
    $ ./cc-oci-runtime --root "$dir" start "$name"

Community
---------

See `the contributing page <https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contact>`_.

Building
--------

Acquiring
~~~~~~~~~

As ``cc-oci-runtime`` contains some golang code, the source tree needs to live
in your ``$GOPATH`` in order to build. The easiest way to get the codebase into
the correct place is with the command::

    $ go get -d github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime/...

The source tree will be placed at
``$GOPATH/src/github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime``

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have the development versions of the following packages
installed on your system:

- check
- glib
- golang - version 1.7 or above
- json-glib
- libmnl
- uuid
- autoconf-archive - version 2017.03.21 or above

Configure Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick start, just run::

  $ ./autogen.sh && make

    If you get an error such as
        configure.ac:43: error: Please install autoconf-archive version ${autoconf_archive_version}
        configure.ac:38: MACRO_CHECK is expanded from...
        configure.ac:43: the top level
        autom4te: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 1
        aclocal: error: echo failed with exit status: 1
        autoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 1

    then you are probably missing a good enough autoconf-archive. A quick workaround
    for this is to execute the following

    $ ./installation/curl-autoconf-archive.sh

This will install the required m4 macros into the `m4` subdirectory.


If you have specific requirements, run::

  $ ./configure --help

... then add the extra "``configure``" flags you want to use::

  $ ./autogen.sh --enable-foo --disable-bar && make

Tests
-----

To run the basic unit tests, run::

  $ make check

To configure the command above to also run the functional tests
(recommended), see the `functional tests README`_.

Configuration
-------------

At the time of writing, the OCI_ had not agreed on how best to handle
VM-based runtimes such as this (see [#oci-vm-config-issue]_).

Until the OCI_ specification clarifies how VM runtimes will be defined,
the runtime will search a number of different data sources for its VM
configuration information.

Unless otherwise specified, each configuration file in this section will
be looked for in the following directories (in order):

- The bundle directory, specified by "``--bundle $bundle_dir``".

- The system configuration directory ("``./configure --sysconfdir=...``").
  
  With no ``--prefix`` or with ``--prefix=/``, the file will be looked
  for in ``/etc/cc-oci-runtime/``".

- The defaults directory.
 
  This is a directory called "``defaults/cc-oci-runtime/``" below the
  configured data directory ("``./configure --datadir=...``").
  
  With no ``--prefix`` or with ``--prefix=/``, the file will be looked
  for in ``/usr/share/defaults/cc-oci-runtime/``".

The first file found will be used and the runtime will log the full path
to each configuration file used (see `Logging`_).

Example files will be available in the "``data/``" directory after the
build has completed. To influence the way these files are generated,
consider using the following "``configure``" options:

- ``--with-qemu-path=``
- ``--with-cc-kernel=``
- ``--with-cc-image=``

.. note:: You may still need to make adjustments to this file to work
   for your environment.

``config.json``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The runtime will consult the OCI configuration file ``config.json``
for a "``vm``" object, according to the proposed OCI specification
[#oci-vm-config-issue]_

``vm.json``
~~~~~~~~~~~

If no "``vm``" object is found in ``config.json``, the file
"``vm.json``" will be looked for which should contain a stand-alone
JSON "``vm``" object specifying the virtual machine configuration.

``hypervisor.args``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file specifies both the full path to the hypervisor binary to use
and all the arguments to be passed to it. The runtime supports
specifying specific options using variables (see `Variable Expansion`_).

Variable Expansion
..................

Currently, the runtime will expand the following `special tags` found in
``hypervisor.args`` appropriately:

- ``@COMMS_SOCKET@`` - path to the hypervisor control socket (QMP socket for qemu).
- ``@CONSOLE_DEVICE@`` - hypervisor arguments used to control where console I/O is sent to.
- ``@IMAGE@`` - Clear Containers rootfs image path (read from ``config.json``).
- ``@KERNEL_PARAMS@`` - kernel parameters (from ``config.json``).
- ``@KERNEL@`` - path to kernel (from ``config.json``).
- ``@NAME@`` - VM name.
- ``@PROCESS_SOCKET@`` - required to detect when hypervisor has started running, and when it has shut down.
- ``@SIZE@`` - size of @IMAGE@ which is auto-calculated.
- ``@UUID@`` - VM uuid.
- ``@WORKLOAD_DIR@`` - path to workload chroot directory that will be mounted (via 9p) inside the VM.
- ``@AGENT_CTL_SOCKET@`` - path to the guest agent control socket ( control serial port for hyperstart)
- ``@AGENT_TTY_SOCKET@`` - path to the guest agent multiplex tty I/O socket ( tty serial port for hyperstart)

Logging
-------

The runtime logs to the file specified by the global ``--log`` option.
However, it can also write to a global log file if the
``--global-log`` option is specified. Note that if both log options are
specified, both log files will be appended to.

The global log potentially provides more detail than the standard log
since it is always written to in ASCII format and includes Process ID
details. Also note that all instances of the runtime will append to
the global log.

Additionally exist the possibility to log hypervisor's stderr and stdout into
``$hypervisorLogDir/$containerId-hypervisor.stderr`` and
``$hypervisorLogDir/$containerId-hypervisor.stdout`` respectively if the
``--hypervisor-log-dir`` option is specified. Note that ``$hypervisorLogDir``
and ``$containerId`` are variables provided by user through
``--hypervisor-log-dir`` option and ``create`` command respectively.

Command-line Interface
----------------------

At the time of writing, the OCI_ has provided recommendations for the
runtime command line interface (CLI) (see [#oci-runtime-cli]_).

However, the OCI_ runtime reference implementation, runc_, has a CLI
which deviates from the recommendations.

This issue has been raised with OCI_ (see [#oci-runtime-cli-clarification]_), but
until the situation is clarified, the runtime strives to support both
the OCI_ CLI and the runc_ CLI interfaces.

Details of the runc_ command line options can be found in the `runc manpage`_.

Note: Next arguments are unique to the runtime at present:
- ``--global-log``
- ``--hypervisor-log-dir``
- ``--shim-path``
- ``--proxy-socket-path``


Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~

list
....

The ``list`` command supports a "``--all``" option that provides
additional information including details of the resources used by the
virtual machine.

Development
-----------

Follow the instructions in `Building`_, but you will also want to install:

- doxygen
- lcov
- valgrind

To build the API documentation::

  $ doxygen Doxyfile

Then, point your browser at ``/tmp/doxygen-cc-oci-runtime``. If you
don't like that location, change the value of ``OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` in
the file ``Doxyfile``.

Debugging
---------

- Specify the ``--enable-debug`` configure option to the ``autogen.sh``
  script which enable debug output, but also disable all compiler and
  linker optimisations.

- If you want to see the hypervisor boot messages, remove "`quiet`" from
  the hypervisor command-line in "``hypervisor.args``".

- Run with the "``--debug``" global option.

- If you want to debug as a non-``root`` user, specify the "``--root``"
  global option. For example::

    $ gdb --args ./cc-oci-runtime \
        --debug \
        --root /tmp/cor/ \
        --global-log /tmp/global.log \
        --hypervisor-log-dir /tmp/ \
        start --console $(tty) $container $bundle_path

- Consult the global Log (see Logging_).
